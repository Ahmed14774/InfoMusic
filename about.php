      At InfoMusic, we believe there is a better way for our customers and artists to express themselves than other convention streaming services.
      Our music website makes it easy to search for the artists and genres you like to listen to.
      You get to create your own account, purchase music and add it to your playlist.
      This website will also be a great opportunity for artists that want their music to be heard by others.
      The artists can connect their social media accounts to our website and introduce their music by uploading to our website.
